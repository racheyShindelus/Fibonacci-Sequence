# Fibonacci-Sequence
Lab Assignment #1_CSC 130
For this assignment, write a program in Java (C++ is acceptable) that times calls to the recursive Fibonacci method for 6 consecutive calls and displays the results.  To break down your program, do the following:

Get the starting argument
Record time before calling your method (function in C++)
Compute and print fib term for the next argument
Record time after calling the method (again, function in C++)
Compute and print elapsed time in seconds (in C++, obtain from system clock from ctime header)
